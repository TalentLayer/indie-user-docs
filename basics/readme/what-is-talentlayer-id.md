# TalentLayerID

## What is a TalentLayerID?

TalentLayer ID is a work identity that allows ownership and growth of reputation across many gig marketplaces. TalentLayer IDs are ERC-721 NFTs that live inside crypto wallets; this means that reputation is self-custodied by the wallet owner and lives separately from integrated platforms. TalentLayer IDs are “soul-bound” in that they can not leave the originating wallet unless a recovery is initiated.

TalentLayerID is the core identity element for service buyers and sellers when interacting with TalentLayer-integrated marketplaces and freelancing tools. The TalentLayer ID is associated with reviews and represents the overall reputation in the ecosystem.

More information on how it is implemented can be found in our guide on the [TalentLayerID smart contract](../../technical-guides/smart-contracts/talentlayerid.sol.md).

## Role-Agnostic IDs

Unlike other freelancing platforms, separate accounts are not needed to hire freelancers and be hired by others.

## TalentLayer ID Handles

Your TalentLayer ID Handle is a unique string of characters and numbers that you can choose when you create your TalentLayer ID. This handle is how others can search for your reputation.

You can have a maximum of 31 characters in your TalentLayer ID and use only low characters, numbers and - or \_.

**Choose wisely:** Make sure you choose your handle carefully - after your ID has been initiated, your handle can not be changed.
