# Lens Protocol - Social

TalentLayer has partnered with Lens, the decentralized social graph, to connect our protocols; enabling platforms building on Lens to offer work-related offerings like job posts, proposals, escrow payments and more, and platforms building on TalentLayer to let users display their social history alongside their work reputations.&#x20;

## Why TalentLayer and 🌱 Lens?

TalentLayer and Lens are both composable infrastructures that teams can build new platforms on top of! We both want to see a world where all users own their data and work platforms benefit from user sharing. So, it’s only natural to team up 🤝.

TalentLayer empowers builders in the Lens community to add freelance and work marketplace functionality to their social apps! PLUS: Work marketplace builders can add social feeds to their apps.
