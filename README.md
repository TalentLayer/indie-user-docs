## The TalentLayer TLDR

TalentLayer **helps marketplace applications like freelance marketplaces and ride-share apps access additional supply or demand when they need it** by tapping into a wider network of users.&#x20;

TalentLayer can also be to build new marketplaces on top of - replacing key backend components, helping you go to market faster. \
\
**TalentLayer's Web 3 API and SDK** is live and available for integration. The Web 3 API and SDK assumes a web 3 native user experience on the platform level. Account delegation and gassless are enabled today so that platform developers can implement account abstraction optionally.

In the coming months we'll be releasing **TalentLayer's Abstracted API and SDK** which will enable platforms to easily integrate TalentLayer without users interacting with web 3 at all: wallet-less onboarding,  delegation (no signing transactions, or approving payments),  fiat payments, and more.&#x20;
