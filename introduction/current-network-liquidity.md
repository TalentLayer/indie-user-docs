# Current Network Liquidity

TalentLayer's network currently is primarily composed of supply and demand in the software developer niche. This means that a TalentLayer integration is most valuable for marketplaces who are seeking to increase transactions in this market segment.&#x20;

We aim to bootstrap network effects in this niche before focusing on other niches.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible today for teams to develop applications in any other niche of the services economy, but there will not be significant best-match liquidity available for them to leverage.&#x20;
