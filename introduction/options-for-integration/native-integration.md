# Native Integration

## TalentLayer as a Backend

Platforms that choose Native Integration opt to use TalentLayer as a backend for their platform, where all supply and demand is listed at the network level for cross-platform deals.

Native Integration is good for teams who may:

* want to have 100% of their current supply and demand listed on the network for cross-platform transactions
* don't have an existing user account system, payments system, or dispute resolution
* are adding marketplace features into an app in a different vertical
* don't want to custody user data for GDPR reasons
* want to avoid building a backend from scratch, to go to market faster

All of your users and service requests will be listed on the network as available supply and demand; any other platform on the network can propose cross-platform transactions with your users.&#x20;

With Native Integrations, each user on your platform has an reputation and profile at the network level that can be viewed by and used on other platforms.&#x20;
