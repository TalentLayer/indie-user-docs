# Value Proposition

TalentLayer is the API connecting the world's marketplaces.&#x20;

TalentLayer **helps marketplace applications like freelance marketplaces and ride-share apps access additional supply or demand when they need it** by tapping into a wider network of users.&#x20;

The supply and demand available at the network level is made up of the demand (requests for service) and supply (people available to work) pushed to the network by integrated platforms.&#x20;

If a user on your platform matches offers with a user supplied by the network, your platform splits the fee earnings on that transaction with whatever platform supplied the other side of the deal. This is a "cross-platform transaction".

Payment remittance, messaging, reviews, dispute resolution, and more are facilitated by TalentLayer for any cross-platform transactions.
