# Reviews

TalentLayer IDâ€™s build their reputation over time through receiving Reviews from counter-parties; people that have engaged in transactions as either a buyer or seller.

A Review is an ERC 721 soulbound NFT that is associated with a TalentLayer ID. New Reputation NFTs are minted whenever a service is completed on TalentLayer. They include information about the service completed and a review from the other party. A TalentLayer ID can have an unlimited number of Reputation NFTs. Service buyers leave Reputation NFTs for service sellers and service sellers leave Reputation NFTs for service buyers - a mutual-review system.
