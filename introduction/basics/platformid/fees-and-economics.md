# Fees & Economics

## Platform Fees

Each Platform can fully configure their fees strategy with 4 different variables:

### originServiceFeeRate

This is a fee that is configured by platforms for jobs that result in the release of an escrow on the TalentLayer network. This is remitted back to the platform that posted the job.&#x20;

_The default configuration of this fee is 0%._&#x20;

### originValidatedProposalFeeRate

This is a fee that is configured by platforms for proposals that result in the release of an escrow on the TalentLayer network. This is remitted back to the platform that posted the job.&#x20;

_The default configuration of this fee is 0%._&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Escrow-Related Fees:** originServiceFeeRate, originValidatedProposalFeeRate enable TalentLayers' interoperability between multiple marketplaces; allowing marketplaces to make money on users and jobs they onboard to the protocol even if they do transactions on other platforms or with users of other platforms.
{% endhint %}

### servicePostingFee

Because many platforms desire to levy fees on job posts, TalentLayer will offer an optional configurable job posting fee.&#x20;

_The default Job Posting Fee will be 0%._&#x20;

### proposalPostingFee

Because many platforms desire to levy fees on proposal posts, TalentLayer will offer an optional configurable proposal posting fee.&#x20;

_The default Proposal Posting Fee will be 0%._&#x20;

## Protocol Fee

This fee is used to support the development of the TalentLayer protocol. It is sent to the TalentLayer treasury. The treasury is currently managed by the TalentLayer Core team and will eventually be transitioned to be managed by the eventual TalentLayer DAO.&#x20;

_This fee is set at 1%._

## Gas Fees

By making transactions, your users will experience any gas or transaction fees required by the blockchain you are interfacing with.&#x20;

## Covering Fees for Users

With our Delegation system, you can cover protocol fees and gas fees on behalf of your users. This allows you to create a "fee-less" experience for users.&#x20;

Fee Sponsorship can be configured with your Platform ID and involves you loading a wallet with cryptos to cover fees that users incur.
