<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 5.43.21 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

"StarterKit" is an open-source fork-able mobile-first marketplace codebase that is a great starting point for teams building on TalentLayer. StarterKit was adapted from the Indie starter codebase, with additional improvments to make it mobile-first.

It's a good first step to set up a local version of StarterKit to...

1. Get to know how frontends interface with TalentLayer
2. Optionally, use Indie as a foundation for your next DAPP.

## Explore the DAPP

We've hosted a version of StarterKit on Mumbai testnet for you to play around with! Have fun.
