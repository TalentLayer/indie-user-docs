# Smart Contracts

## Writing to TalentLayer Core

Writing is facilitated by connecting your platform with the various TalentLayer Core smart contracts and triggering different actions.

Writing is necessary to create a user’s TalentLayer ID, mint reputation updates, and create services.

To write to TalentLayer Core, you must connect with the appropriate TalentLayer smart contract for the action you intend to take.

We currently have a fork-able codebase that is set up to interact with TalentLayer’s smart contracts: the Indie DAPP.
