# The Graph

Welcome to the TalentLayer API documentation. This documentation is intended to help you get started with the TalentLayer API. It is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

TalentLayer provides querying mechanisms by using the tools provided by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/). The [TalentLayer Subgraph](https://github.com/TalentLayer/talentlayer-id-subgraph) is the implementation of [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) that should be used to query TalentLayer data. The Data that can be queried is defined by [the Subgraph Schema](https://github.com/TalentLayer/talentlayer-id-subgraph/blob/main/schema.graphql).

We have listed all deployed graph endpoints on the [introduction page](./introduction.md).
